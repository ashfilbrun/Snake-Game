# Project 1 - Snake: the game

I chose the game of snake because it seems like a fun challenge to create.


## MVP 

1. Be a new repo. Create a new repo in your GitHub and build your project there. DO NOT name your repository Project 1. Give it a real name.

2. Include a beautiful, professional README.md (use markdown)

3. Utilize flexbox or grid (or both)

4. Have at least 20 meaningful git commits. You should be committing your changes every time you build a new feature.

5. Your code should be properly indented, spaced, and within code blocks. DO NOT leave in commented out code that was left unused (bad practice). Comments, if in your code at all, should be in your code to describe what your functions are doing.

6. Display proper use of global variables and function parameters (function scopes)

7. Use camelCase for JavaScript variables

8. Be deployed on Surge (We will cover this on Wednesday of project week)


## Setup - THEME

Alice in wonderland caterpillar themed.

Caterpillar will drink the solution and continue on dizzy maze.

Upon inital loading of website, the page will read "Snake" at the top of the page. 

Next you will see a game board with a prize sitting somewhere in it.

The goal is for snake to capture the prize without crashing into the sides of the maze.


## How to Play - Win Conditions

Press arrow keys left right up down to navigate the snake around the maze.

Player wins when snake has collected all 10 prizes without crashing into the outside walls of the maze.

Might have three levels of game play, each more challenging than the last.
    -each layer gets slightly more distorted as caterpillar smokes more
