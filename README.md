# GLOW WORM!

I chose the game of snake because it seemed like a fun challenge to create. I decided to make my snake game glow worm themed.

## Setup / How to Play

The game has a glow worm theme. The worm eats the special substance in order to start glowing. The more special substance the worm eats, the longer its tail will grow.

Upon inital loading of website, the page will read "Glow Worm" at the top of the page. 

Next you will see a game board with a special substance sitting somewhere in it.

Press ENTER to start game!

Press arrow keys left, right, up, or down to navigate the worm around the game board.

The goal is for the glow worm to eat as many special substances as possible without crashing into the sides of the maze or its own tail.
