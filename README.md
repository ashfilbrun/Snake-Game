# Project 1 - Snake: the game

I chose the game of snake because it seemed like a fun challenge to create. I decided to make my snake game glow worm themed. 

CLICK HERE TO PLAY GAME! [Glow Worm Game](https://glowworm.surge.sh).


## MVP 

1. Be a new repo. Create a new repo in your GitHub and build your project there. DO NOT name your repository Project 1. Give it a real name.

2. Include a beautiful, professional README.md (use markdown)

3. Utilize flexbox or grid (or both)

4. Have at least 20 meaningful git commits. You should be committing your changes every time you build a new feature.

5. Your code should be properly indented, spaced, and within code blocks. DO NOT leave in commented out code that was left unused (bad practice). Comments, if in your code at all, should be in your code to describe what your functions are doing.

6. Display proper use of global variables and function parameters (function scopes)

7. Use camelCase for JavaScript variables

8. Be deployed on Surge (We will cover this on Wednesday of project week)


## Setup / How to Play

The game has a glow worm theme. The worm eats the special substance in order to start glowing. The more special substance the worm eats, the longer its tail will grow.

Upon inital loading of website, the page will read "Glow Worm" at the top of the page. 

Next you will see a game board with a special substance sitting somewhere in it.

Press ENTER to start game!

Press arrow keys left, right, up, or down to navigate the worm around the game board.

The goal is for the glow worm to eat as many special substances as possible without crashing into the sides of the maze or its own tail.
